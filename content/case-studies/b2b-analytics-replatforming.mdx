    "How a domain-driven frontend re-platform improved delivery speed, accessibility, and enterprise retention.",
};

## Context

A data-heavy analytics suite supported enterprise users with complex reporting workflows. The legacy frontend had become monolithic, making feature development slow and error-prone.

The product roadmap required faster iteration, stronger accessibility, and maintainable architecture.

## Challenges

- New engineers faced steep onboarding due to dense module coupling.
- Accessibility debt accumulated in key reporting and filter journeys.
- Core features moved slowly from discovery to production.
- Technical ownership boundaries were unclear between teams.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1) Domain decomposition

Feature domains were separated with explicit ownership and API contracts. This made changes safer, easier to review, and less likely to introduce side effects.

### 2) Semantic interaction model

Reporting surfaces were rebuilt with semantic HTML and keyboard-first behavior as baseline expectations, improving usability and audit outcomes.

### 3) Review and quality rubric

Code review standards were formalized around accessibility, SSR compatibility, and performance impact before merge approval.

### 4) Product observability alignment

UI instrumentation was aligned to business outcomes so teams could connect frontend changes with activation, retention, and workflow efficiency.

## Execution

The re-platform was executed in bounded increments to avoid delivery stalls. Legacy routes were replaced behind controlled rollouts, with benchmark metrics tracked after each release.

This phased strategy improved release confidence while architectural debt was retired.

## Outcomes

- Feature delivery lead time improved by **36%** year over year.
- Accessibility audit score increased from **78 to 98**.
- Enterprise account retention improved through faster reporting workflows.

## Key Takeaway

When architectural boundaries, accessibility rigor, and product metrics are connected, teams ship faster with more reliable outcomes.
