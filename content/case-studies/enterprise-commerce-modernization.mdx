## Context

A multi-region commerce platform served millions of monthly sessions, but the frontend was fragmented across legacy patterns. Teams shipped slowly, and mobile checkout showed rising friction.

The organization needed a frontend foundation that supported faster delivery without increasing risk.

## Challenges

- Mobile checkout flow had visible latency on critical interactions.
- Shared UI patterns were duplicated, leading to behavioral drift across squads.
- Regression risk increased as release frequency grew.
- Accessibility quality varied between journeys and teams.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1) Server-first rendering baseline

The platform moved to Next.js App Router with Server Components as the default model. This reduced client JavaScript and improved initial render performance on checkout routes.

### 2) Typed interface boundaries

We introduced strict TypeScript contracts between shared UI primitives and feature modules. This reduced integration ambiguity and prevented runtime mismatches during releases.

### 3) Design system alignment

Reusable semantic primitives were standardized for layout and content patterns. This gave squads a shared language and reduced repeated implementation work.

### 4) Quality gates in delivery

Route-level performance budgets and accessibility checks were integrated into CI to ensure regressions were caught before merge.

## Execution

The migration was staged route-by-route. High-value journeys were prioritized first, with observability instrumentation added before each rollout. This sequencing enabled impact tracking while controlling release risk.

Cross-team reviews were framed around architecture consistency, accessibility acceptance criteria, and runtime performance impact.

## Outcomes

- Checkout completion improved by **18%** in two quarters.
- Release regression rate decreased by **42%** after standardization.
- First-contentful paint improved by **31%** on high-traffic routes.

## Key Takeaway

Frontend scale came from disciplined constraints: server-first defaults, strict contracts, and shared quality gates. The result was faster delivery with higher release confidence.
